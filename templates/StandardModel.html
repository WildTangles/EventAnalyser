                    <p style="height:2818px;">The key idea in particle physics is that everything at its most fundamental level can be described as particles interacting. These particles and their properties are catalogued in something called the <em>standard model</em>. Let’s
                        begin to by learning about some of these particles and how they’re organized.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let’s first
                        look at the nucleus of ‘common matter’ – protons and neutrons. These protons and neutrons are in fact composite particles, meaning they are in fact made of even smaller particles. In the case of protons and neutrons, they are composed
                        of particles called quarks. Let’s have a look at some of the properties of the constituent quarks of protons and neutron. They are the ‘up’ and ‘down’ quarks. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>MeV is a unit used
                        a lot in particle physics – for our purposes just know that it’s a very small amount of mass. What’s more important is to consider these particles’ masses compared to each other (their relative masses). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The proton is made of 2 ‘up’ quarks and 1 ‘down’ quark while the neutron is made of 2 ‘down’ quarks and 1 ‘up’ quark. One can see that if we add the charges for the proton and neutron, we get the expected
                        answers – the proton has an electric charge of +1 while the neutron is electrically neutral (ie has an electric charge of 0). The ‘up’ and ‘down’ quarks are by far the most common quarks we see around us in everyday stuff, but
                        they are not the only quarks in the universe.<br><br>The ‘up’ and ‘down’ quarks are called the ‘first generation’ of quarks. They are the lightest pair of quarks. There are two more generations of quarks – each generation has a
                        pair of quarks with charges analogous to the ‘up’ and ‘down’ quarks higher mass. You can consider these higher generation of quarks as ‘heavier versions’ of the ‘up’ and ‘down’ quarks. Each higher generation is a heavier pair of
                        quarks. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quarks are never found in isolation.
                        This is because of the strong force. When two quarks separate, the energy created by the strong force increases dramatically. Before a quark can ever be separated into isolation, quark-antiquark pairs are created hence isolation
                        is not possible. This phenomenon is known as colour confinement.<br>These quarks are held together by particles called gluons.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Electrons are fundamental particles and belong to a different class of particles called leptons. Like quarks, leptons come in pairs too; the ‘sibling’ to each lepton is its neutrino so, for example,
                        the electron’s pair is called the ‘electron neutrino’. Let’s look at a table like we did for the ‘up’ and ‘down’ quarks.<br><br>Note that the electron is significantly lighter than either of the lightest quarks and the neutrino
                        is much, much lighter still. In fact, so light that when the standard model was formulated it was considered massless!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like quarks, leptons have generations too. There are two more known generations called the muon and tao generations. Each generation has a pair like the electron and the electron neutrino but not much
                        is known about the masses of the neutrinos since it’s a huge experimental challenge.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Both
                        leptons and quarks are under the broader class of particles called fermions. These are the so called ‘matter’ particles. To understand the difference between leptons and quarks, we know the fundamental forces in physics.<br>&nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are four fundamental forces in the universe - electromagnetism, the weak force, gravity and the strong
                        force. Both leptons and quarks can interact via the first three forces listed but only quarks interact with the strong nuclear force. Each of these forces has particles that mediate interaction. These particles are called bosons.<br>&nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let’s revisit the helium atom’s nucleus with 2 neutrons and 2 protons. The particles that correspond to
                        the strong force are called gluons. These gluons hold together the quarks into protons and neutrons. The resultant protons and neutrons are yet again bound by gluons, holding together the nucleus. The strong force is thus responsible
                        for holding together quarks into protons and neutrons AND responsible for holding together the protons and neutrons into atomic nuclei.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; Continuing with a helium atom, we know that the electrons are held to the nucleus by the electrostatic force since electrons and the nucleus have opposite charges. The boson that corresponds to electrostatic force is called
                        the photon.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Weak Force in involved with radioactive decay. You might be familiar with radioactive
                        decay if you’ve come across alpha, beta or gamma decay. Let’s look at a beta decay. Here a down quark decays into an up quarks and a &nbsp;boson.&nbsp;<br><br>Once the down quark converts to an up quark, it releases a &nbsp;boson.
                        This boson then decays into an electron and anti-electron neutrino. The anti-electron neutrino is an example of antimatter which is discussed later in the text. This interaction will be discussed in more detail later, it’s here
                        to provide and example of a weak interaction and the role of an weak force mediating particle like the &nbsp;boson.<br>When it comes to quantum theories, gravity is always the elephant in the room. Gravity has never been completely
                        well described by particle physics and there is no evidence for a gravity related boson a.k.a. the hypothetical “graviton”. The accepted theory of gravity is Einstein’s theory of General Relativity and it’s a completely independent
                        physical theory.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lastly we have the Higgs boson. This particle somewhat different from the rest of
                        the particles because it’s not associated with any fundamental force. This is a recently confirmed particle (in 2012) but was theorised decades ago. The field associated with the Higgs boson is responsible for giving some fundamental
                        particles their mass.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We also have antiparticles like the mentioned anti-electron
                        neutrino. Anti-particles have the exact opposite properties and their particle twins but have the same mass. For example, we also have an anti-electron (called the ‘positron’). It weighs the same as the electron but has a +1 electric
                        charge.Below is a picture of the entire standard model to summarise what’s been discussed.<br><br><br><br></p>
